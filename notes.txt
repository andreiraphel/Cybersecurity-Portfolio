POSSIBLE TECHNICAL INTERVIEW QUESTION

What is the TCP/IP model? 

The TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network. 

What is the OSI model?

The OSI model stands for open systems interconnection (OSI) model. It is a standardized concept that describes the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network. 

What are SIEM tools and what are they used for?
